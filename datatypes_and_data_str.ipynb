        "\n",
        "\n",
        "1. What are data structures, and why are they important?\n",
        "Ans:\n",
        "Data structures are ways to store and organize data in a computer so we can use it easily. They help in storing data properly and doing operations like searching, sorting, and updating faster. Some common data structures are lists, tuples, dictionaries, and sets in Python. They are important because they make coding easier and programs faster.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Explain the difference between mutable and immutable data types with examples.\n",
        "Ans:\n",
        "Mutable means the value can be changed after it's created. Immutable means the value cannot be changed.\n",
        "\n",
        "Mutable Example: list1 = [1, 2, 3] → I can do list1[0] = 10\n",
        "\n",
        "Immutable Example: tuple1 = (1, 2, 3) → I can’t do tuple1[0] = 10\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "3. What are the main differences between lists and tuples in Python?\n",
        "Ans:\n",
        "Lists are mutable, meaning we can change their elements, while tuples are immutable and cannot be changed once created. Lists use square brackets [] and tuples use round brackets (). Also, tuples are faster and use less memory than lists.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "4. Describe how dictionaries store data.\n",
        "Ans:\n",
        "Dictionaries in Python store data in key-value pairs. Every value is connected to a key. For example:\n",
        "my_dict = {'name': 'Amit', 'age': 20}\n",
        " Now, 'name' is the key and 'Amit' is the value.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        " 5. Why might you use a set instead of a list in Python?\n",
        "Ans:\n",
        "Sets are used when we want only unique items. They don’t allow duplicates and they are faster for checking if an item exists.\n",
        "For example, set1 = {1, 2, 3, 2} will store {1, 2, 3} only.\n",
        "\n",
        " 6. What is a string in Python, and how is it different from a list?\n",
        "Ans:\n",
        "A string is a group of characters like \"Hello\". A list can have many types of items like numbers, strings, etc.\n",
        "Example:\n",
        "\n",
        "String: \"Python\"\n",
        "\n",
        "List: [1, \"Python\", 3.5]\n",
        "Also, both are sequences, but strings are immutable and lists are mutable.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "7. How do tuples ensure data integrity in Python?\n",
        "Ans:\n",
        "Tuples are immutable, which means once we create a tuple, we can’t change its values. So, if we want data to stay safe and not be changed by mistake, we can use tuples. That’s why they help in keeping data safe or constant.\n",
        "  \n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "8. What is a hash table, and how does it relate to dictionaries in Python?\n",
        "Answer:\n",
        "A hash table is a data structure that maps keys to values using a hashing function. In Python, dictionaries are implemented using hash tables, allowing fast data lookup and storage.  \n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "9. Can lists contain different data types in Python?\n",
        "Answer:\n",
        "Yes. Python lists are heterogeneous, meaning they can hold elements of different data types.\n",
        "\n",
        "numbers = [1, \"two\", 3.0, [4, 5]]\n",
        "\n",
        "10. Explain why strings are immutable in Python.\n",
        "Answer:\n",
        "Strings are immutable because once we make them, we can’t change them. It helps keep our programs safe from unwanted changes, and Python can also run faster.\n",
        "Strings are immutable to:\n",
        ">Ensure data security.\n",
        "\n",
        ">Allow hashing (strings can be used as dictionary keys).\n",
        "\n",
        ">Improve performance due to memory optimization.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "11. What advantages do dictionaries offer over lists for certain tasks?\n",
        "Answer: Some of the advantages are;\n",
        "\n",
        ">Faster data lookup using keys.\n",
        "\n",
        ">Direct access via keys rather than searching through indices.\n",
        "\n",
        ">suitable for representing real-world mappings (e.g., student ID → name).\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "12. Describe a scenario where using a tuple would be preferable over a list.\n",
        "Answer:\n",
        "When we have data that should not change, like a date of birth or coordinates (x, y), we should use a tuple. That way, the data stays fixed.\n",
        "\n",
        "Example:\n",
        "Suppose we are storing the location of a place on a map, like (latitude, longitude)\n",
        "location = (28.61, 77.20)\n",
        "This location should not change, so using a tuple is better than a list.\n",
        "Also, if we want to use a group of values as a key in a dictionary, we need a tuple because lists can’t be used as keys.\n",
        "student_data = {(\"Rahul\", \"Science\"): 88}\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "13. How do sets handle duplicate values in Python?\n",
        "Answer:\n",
        "Sets automatically remove duplicates. So if we add the same value twice, it only keeps one copy.\n",
        "\n",
        "Example:s = set([1, 2, 2, 3])\n",
        " # Result: {1, 2, 3}\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "14. How does the “in” keyword work differently for lists and dictionaries?\n",
        "Answer:\n",
        "In lists, it checks if a value is there.\n",
        "\n",
        "In dictionaries, it checks if a key is there.\n",
        "\n",
        "Exampl:3 in [1, 2, 3]  # True\n",
        "\"name\" in {\"name\": \"Maya\"}  # True\n",
        "\"Maya\" in {\"name\": \"Maya\"}  # False (not a key)\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "15. Can you modify the elements of a tuple? Explain why or why not.\n",
        "Answer:\n",
        "No, we cannot modify the elements of a tuple.\n",
        "This is because tuples are immutable in Python, which means once a tuple is created, its values cannot be changed, added, or deleted.\n",
        "Example:\n",
        "my_tuple = (10, 20, 30)\n",
        "my_tuple[1] = 50  \n",
        ">>result=error\n",
        "\n",
        "Why immutability is useful:\n",
        ">It keeps the data safe from accidental changes.\n",
        "\n",
        ">Tuples can be used as keys in dictionaries because they don’t change.\n",
        "\n",
        ">Good for fixed data like dates, coordinates, etc.\n",
        "\n",
        "16. What is a nested dictionary, and give an example of its use case.\n",
        "Answer:\n",
        "A nested dictionary is a dictionary that contains other dictionaries as values.\n",
        "\n",
        "Example:\n",
        "students = {\n",
        "  '101': {'name': 'Alex', 'age': 20},\n",
        "  '102': {'name': 'Maya', 'age': 22}\n",
        "}\n",
        "Use case: Storing structured data like records.\n",
        "\n",
        "17. Describe the time complexity of accessing elements in a dictionary.\n",
        "Answer:\n",
        "\n",
        "Average case: O(1) due to hashing.\n",
        "\n",
        "Worst case: O(n) in case of hash collisions, though rare in practice.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "18. In what situations are lists preferred over dictionaries?\n",
        "Answer:\n",
        "\n",
        ">When order matters (e.g., ordered sequences).\n",
        "\n",
        ">When data is not key-based.\n",
        "\n",
        ">For simple iteration or aggregation.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "19. Why are dictionaries considered unordered, and how does that affect data retrieval?\n",
        "Answer:\n",
        "In older versions of Python, dictionaries were unordered, which means the items didn’t stay in the same order as we added them.\n",
        "\n",
        "From Python 3.7 onwards, dictionaries do keep the insertion order, but they are still not like lists — we can’t get items by their position (like dict[0]).\n",
        "\n",
        "We always get values by using their keys, not by their place in the dictionary.\n",
        "\n",
        "Example:\n",
        "student_id= {\"name\": \"Amit\", \"age\": 20}\n",
        "print(student_id[\"name\"])  # ✅ Works\n",
        "print(student_id[0])       # ❌ Error: Keys, not index\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "20. Explain in short the difference between a list and a dictionary in terms of data retrieval.\n",
        "Answer:\n",
        "In a list, we get data using an index number (like list[0]), but in a dictionary, we get data using a key (like dict[\"name\"]).\n",
        "\n",
        "List → position-based access\n",
        "\n",
        "Dictionary → key-based access\n",
